      Hi I am Ayesha Rahman. I am a rising senior at Eastern Regional Highschool. I have two sibilings, Zarif who's currently studying electrical engineering at Georgia Tech, and Rehan who's 12 rising to 7th grade at Voorhees Middle School. I love my brothers and enjoy spending time with them down the shore and hanging out with them. I have an interest in studying computer science in college, my interest came from Zarif telling me about the power of having python knowledge. From that day on I have just found such an interest CS. I am looking forward to going to college and meeting new people and just keep on learning. I love listening to music and watching the Bachlor on Monday nights.
